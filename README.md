## Issue tracking across repos

See [`waffle.io/rcc-uchicago/meta`](https://waffle.io/rcc-uchicago/meta) for demo of integrated issue tracking across project work.

---

We're currently testing [multi-repo support](https://waffle.io/blog/2014/04/23/get-more-done-with-multi-repo-support/) in [waffle.io](http://waffle.io/).

Ultimately looking for a configurable dashboard view of all `rcc-uchicago` repo activity, showing commits, issues, and milestones across critical repos.

`waffle.io` is not it, but potentially useful as an integrated issue tracker.
